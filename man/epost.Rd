\title{epost - uploading UIDs to Entrez}
\usage{
  epost(uid, db = NULL, webenv = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{uid}{(Required) List of UIDs provided as a
  character or as an \code{esearch} object.}

  \item{db}{(Required if \code{uid} is a character vector)
  Database containing the UIDs in the input list.}

  \item{webenv}{(Optional) Web Environment. If provided,
  this parameter specifies the Web Environment that will
  receive the UIDs sent by \code{epost}. \code{epost} will
  create a new query key associated with that Web
  Environment. The \code{webenv} value is usually returned
  by a previous call to \code{\link{esearch}},
  \code{\link{epost}} or \code{\link{elink}}. If no
  \code{webenv} parameter is provided, the EPost utility
  will create a new Web Environment and post the UIDs to
  query key 1.}
}
\value{
  An \code{\linkS4class{epost}} object.
}
\description{
  \code{epost} uses the Entrez EPost utility to upload
  primary UIDs to the Entrez History server or append a
  list of UIDs to an existing set of UIDs attached to a Web
  Environment.
}
\details{
  \code{epost} returns an integer label called a query key
  and an encoded cookie string called a Web environment.
  \code{epost} objects can then be used instead of a UID
  list in subsequent calls to \code{\link{esummary}},
  \code{\link{efetch}}, or \code{\link{elink}}.
